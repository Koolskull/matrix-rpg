# Matrix RPG Client

A decentralized RPG game built on Matrix protocol with Monero integration for achievements and rewards.

I would like to be able to essentially build a MMORPG that has play-to-earn qualities on as minimal an interface as possible. 2D-style like zelda, or maybe moreso like VMK (Virtual Magic Kingdom).

Each room would represent a physical space for your character to walk around in, and would have it's own live chat where you talk with other players.

This game would be mostly social with minigames connecting the experience with colorful elements.

I would like to possibly have some rooms be different maybe with threeJS for 3D experiences, but that is not the most important version for early implementation.

## Project Overview

This project combines several key technologies:
- Matrix protocol for decentralized chat and room management
- Monero blockchain for micro-transactions and rewards
- Pixel art RPG game engine
- Cross-platform client interface

### Core Features

1. **Matrix Integration**
   - Each game level represented as a Matrix room
   - Secure user authentication using Matrix accounts
   - Real-time chat functionality
   - Room-based progression system

2. **Game Engine**
   - 640x448 pixel art display
   - Zelda-style top-down RPG mechanics
   - Sprite-based character and environment system
   - Room-based navigation

3. **Monero Integration**
   - Atomic unit rewards for achievements
   - Secure wallet management
   - Transaction verification
   - Seed phrase recovery system

4. **UI Components**
   - Chat dialog interface
   - Game viewport
   - Menu system (Settings, Wallet, Profile)
   - Navigation controls

## Technical Decisions

### Why React + TypeScript?
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong type safety
- Rich ecosystem of libraries
- Easy state management
- Component-based architecture
- Hot reloading for development

### Why Not Other Options?
- **Vanilla JS**: Would require more boilerplate and manual DOM management
- **C++**: Higher development complexity, less web-friendly
- **Other Frameworks**: React provides the best balance of features and simplicity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Matrix account
- Monero wallet (optional for development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd matrix_client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Matrix Configuration
MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL=your_homeserver_url
MATRIX_USER_ID=your_user_id
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token

# Monero Configuration
MONERO_WALLET_RPC_URL=your_wallet_rpc_url
MONERO_WALLET_PASSWORD=your_wallet_password
```

## Development Guidelines

### Matrix Integration
- Use matrix-js-sdk for Matrix protocol integration
- Implement room-based game state management
- Handle user authentication and session management

### Game Development
- Use HTML5 Canvas for game rendering
- Implement sprite-based animation system
- Create room transition system
- Design achievement system

### Monero Integration
- Use monero-javascript for wallet integration
- Implement atomic unit transaction system
- Create secure seed phrase management
- Design reward distribution system

### Security Considerations
- Never store private keys in plain text
- Implement proper encryption for sensitive data
- Use secure WebSocket connections
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow Matrix security best practices
